In this project several models are implemented and simulated with different properties to generate random numbers. The results of these models are analyzed to test the behaviour of the randomness of the number generated. New techniques are proposed to enhance the quality of the random number generated such as changing the neighbourhood size for two-dimensional cell model, the way the number extracted from the model and applying different delays for the rules. The results of the simulation shows out these enhancements proposed to the models, help in producing better randomness in the number generated.

The states of the cells are of type Boolean. Two-dimension 8 X 8 cellular model with a neighbourhood size of 5 cells is simulated.

Example of a uniform model output for rule 15 with fixed delay: 
By running the model "rule15.ma" with "rule15.bat" script.

Example of a uniform model output for rule 63 with fixed delay:
